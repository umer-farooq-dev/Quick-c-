C# is a language with the features of C++, programming style like Java and rapid application model of BASIC. If you already know the C++ language, it will take you less than an hour to quickly go through the syntax of C#. Familiarity with Java will be a plus, as Java program structure, the concept of packages and garbage collection will definitely help you learn C# more quickly. So while discussing C# language constructs, I will assume, you know C++.  This article discusses the C# language constructs and features using code examples, in a brief and comprehensive way, so that you just by having a glance at the code, can understand the concepts.  Note: This article is not for C# gurus. There must be some other beginner's articles on C#, but this is yet another one.  Following topics of C# language are discussed:  Program structure Namespaces Data types Variables Operators and expressions Enumerations Statements Classes and structs Modifiers Properties Interfaces Function parameters Arrays Indexers Boxing and unboxing Delegates Inheritance and polymorphism Following are not discussed:  Things which are common in C++ and C#. Concepts like garbage collection, threading, file processing etc. Data type conversions Exception handling .NET library
