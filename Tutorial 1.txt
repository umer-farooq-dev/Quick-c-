/* Program structure
Like C++, C# is case-sensitive. Semi colon (;) is the statement separator. Unlike C++, there are no separate declaration (header) and implementation (CPP) files in C#. All code (class declaration and implementation) is placed in one file with extension cs.

Have a look at this Hello world program in C#. */

//Code Example

using System;

namespace MyNameSpace

{

class HelloWorld

{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");
     }
}

}

/*
Everything in C# is packed into a class and classes in C# are packed into namespaces (just like files in a folder). Like C++, a main method is the entry point of your program. C++'s main function is called main whereas C#'s main function starts with capital M and is named as Main.

No need to put a semi colon after a class block or struct definition. It was in C++, C# doesn't require that. */


/*
Namespace
Every class is packaged into a namespace. Namespaces are exactly the same concept as in C++, but in C# we use namespaces more frequently than in C++. You can access a class in a namespace using dot (.) qualifier. MyNameSpace is the namespace in hello world program above.

Now consider you want to access the HelloWorld class from some other class in some other namespace.*/

//Example

using System;
namespace AnotherNameSpace
{    
    class AnotherClass
    {
        public void Func()
        {
            Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");
        }
    }
}
