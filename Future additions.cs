Future additions
This article is just a quick overview of the C# language so that you can just become familiar with the language features. Although I have tried to discuss almost all the major concepts in C# in a brief and comprehensive way with code examples, yet I think there is lot much to be added and discussed.

In future, I would like to add more commands and concepts not yet discussed, including events etc. I would also like to write for beginners, about Windows programming using C#.
